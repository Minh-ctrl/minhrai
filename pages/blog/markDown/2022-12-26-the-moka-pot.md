## Hey there
___
If you've came across this website then that could only mean two things:
1. You're a friend of mine
2. You're stalking me cause no way in hell is this website remotely SEO friendly (°ロ°) !  
___
In any case, welcome to *THE_MOKA_POT*, my very own website that i've built from scratch. 
My reasons for making this blog come in many forms, but essentially they could be boiled down to two reason, *Experimentation* and *Sharing*. 

# *EXPERIMENTATION*
___
I built this website as a ground and hub towards current and future web experimentations for myself, for now the blog itself is an experimentation in web technologies using nuxt 3. 

Personally I really do believe that the most effective form of learning is putting whatever you learned from books/videos/lectures into real practice and this blog is a *somewhat* small culmination of that for me. 
 
I've learned all the individual skills and knowledge to make this very blog on different work/projects but never synthesize them together in order to make something holistic. So the blog that you see here is the result of me putting all that I've learned into practice.

In the future I'd like to dabble further into 3d technologies as well as honing my crafts on web development so you can also expect to see weird one-off experiments that I host on this website as well (TBD).

# *Sharing*
___
An important skill that is especially important in software development is the ability to *learn*. Often, for the sake of development, you are asked to utilize a skill/technology/framework/[insert buzz word here] that you've never used in your life before. As such, getting comfortable with doing something new everytime is something that most developer have to be ok with in order to improve themselves. In that spirit, I'd like to share what I've learned making this project!
___
1.  New features Nuxt 3 has to offer (auto-imports is amazing...). 
2.  SPA deployment.
3.  Working with syntax highlight and markdown rendering on the web.
4.  Gained deeper understanding of node built-in modules (notably file system or "fs")

# *closing thoughts*
That's all for now. I'm personally excited at what the future will bring in the coming years, I hope to document my progress as much as possible for myself and (hopefully) others can benefit from my writing. 

Here's a bonus IDE screenshot of the very project you're seeing right here:
