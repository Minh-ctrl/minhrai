## Hey there
___
if you've came across this website then that could only mean two things:
1. You're a friend of mine
2. You're stalking me cause no way in hell is this website remotely SEO friendly (°ロ°) !  
___
In any case, welcome to *THE_MOKA_POT*, my very own website that i've built from scratch. 
My reasons for making this blog come in many forms, but essentially they could be boiled down to two reason, *experimentation* and *sharing*. 

# *EXPERIMENTATION*
___
I built this website as a ground and hub towards current and future web experimentations for myself, for now the blog itself is an experimentation in web technologies using nuxt 3 (very impressed so far with nuxt 3 btw).  

Personally I really do believe that the most effective form of learning is putting whatever you learned from books/videos/lectures into real practice and this blog is a *somewhat* small culmination of that for me. 
 
I've learned all the individual skills and knowledge to make this very blog on different work/projects but never synthesize them together in order to make something holistic. That has been a big concern of mine for a while.
